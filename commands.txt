Get-ChildItem -Recurse | Select-Object FullName

Explanation:-
This command recursively lists all files and directories along with their full paths. 
Run this command in the root directory of your project in the integrated terminal of Visual Studio Code, 
and it will display the full directory structure including files.


Question?
Ans:- Yes, you can iterate through the results of the Get-ChildItem command 
and save them to a text file temporarily. 

Here's how you can do it:
# Retrieve all items (files and directories) in the current directory and its subdirectories
$items = Get-ChildItem -Recurse | Select-Object FullName

# Define the path for the text file
$textFilePath = "directory_structure.txt"

# Iterate through each item and append its full path to the text file
foreach ($item in $items) {
    Add-Content -Path $textFilePath -Value $item.FullName
}

# Output a message indicating the text file has been created
Write-Output "Directory structure has been saved to $textFilePath"

# Open the text file using the default program
Invoke-Item $textFilePath



Explanation:-
You can run this script in the integrated terminal of Visual Studio Code 
to create the directory_structure.txt file containing the directory structure temporarily.
